# p1-TylerBagala-GetBud
A budget tracker to categorize purchases and compare income to expenses.

# Proposal
GetBud is a budget tracking application designed to help users categorize their purchases and track how much of their income they are using. This in turn guides users into identifying where they spend the most of their monthly income as well as tracking where they could trim their budget and save money. The system offers a varied set of categories to classify user purchases as well as offer stats from the individual user's spending history, including percentages of income and generalistic projections on future saving/spending goals.

# Users will be able to
1)	Log into the system with a unique username
2)	Provide information on their monthly income and major expenses as well as individual purchases throughout the month/year.
3)	Set a maximum spending goal as well as goals for each major spending category.
4)	Get statistics on where they spend their money each month
5)	See projections on how much they could save with adjustments in their budget
